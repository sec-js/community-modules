1. Run build.bat from Visual Studio Native Tools Command Prompt.

This produces a package directory as output and also generates package.zip.

2. Start an Administrative Command Prompt
3. cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Scythe\Platform\Server
4. python install_thirdparty_module.py --password <postgres password from %ProgramFiles(x86)%\scythe\common\settings.ini> --module-path <directory path of "package" folder generated by build.bat>


5. In module's python code, you may call: `db.get_setting_value("language")`. This will return a language id string such as: `en-US`. You may use this result to present localized strings in the user interface.

6. You may call: `db.get_campaign_operating_system_name(campaign_name)`. This will return the string `windows` for Windows campaigns.

7. We do not support a mechanism to localize display name or description for third-party modules as of yet.
